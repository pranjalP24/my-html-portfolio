<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hello! Myself Pranjal. I am learning web development. I already love programming and am also loving web development. </p>
<p>I am making this new project. I hope I will open this project when i'll get older and I shall be in a very better position than this. I believe you would have done a lot of other internships and ofcourse you must have earned some euros from freelancing. I hope you are sstudying in TU Munich. I know you are at one of the best phases in life.</p>
<p>Just write this similar note for your next 10 year old self. I wish you luch for future.</p>
<p>Love, Pranjal :)</p>
